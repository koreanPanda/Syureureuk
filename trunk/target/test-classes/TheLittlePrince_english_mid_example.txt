#1[I saw /a picture of a boa snake /swallowing an animal /in a book /when I was six years old.]
#2[Boas sleep /through the six months /for digestion /after they swallow their food /without chewing it.]
#3[I drew /my first drawing /with a colored pencil.]
#4[I showed /my masterpiece /to the grown-ups, /and asked them /whether the drawing frightened them.]
#5[But they answered /that no one would be frightened /by a hat.]
#6[My drawing /was not a picture of a hat /but a picture of a boa /digesting an elephant.]
#7[I drew another drawing /since the grown-ups were not able /to understand it.]
