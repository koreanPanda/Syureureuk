I saw a picture of a boa snake swallowing an animal in a book when I was six years old.
Boas sleep through the six months for digestion after they swallow their food without chewing it.
I drew my first drawing with a colored pencil.
I showed my masterpiece to the grown-ups, and asked them whether the drawing frightened them.
But they answered that no one would be frightened by a hat.
My drawing was not a picture of a hat but a picture of a boa digesting an elephant.
I drew another drawing since the grown-ups were not able to understand it.
